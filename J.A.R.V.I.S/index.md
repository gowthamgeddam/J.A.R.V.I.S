## Just *A*nother Repository of Valuable Insights and Stories

Lately, I've been fascinated by the concepts such as `second brain`, `linked notes`, and `learning in public`.

So I started this repo to store and share my thoughts, things Iâ€™m learning in tech, plus random insights from articles, videos, conversations, and whatever else catches my attention.

### Tools

+ [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to edit my notes and link them
+ [Quartz - static site generator](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) to generate static site from my notes
+ [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host my site online

You can check the repo @ [https://github.com/gowthamgeddam/J.A.R.V.I.S](https://github.com/gowthamgeddam/J.A.R.V.I.S)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Instead of [forking](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/forks) original [quartz github repo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), I have cloned it to avoid Cross-Fork Object Reference [CFOR vulnerability](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github). But thanks to [MIT License of Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/v4/LICENSE.txt), I'm allowed to do this.
